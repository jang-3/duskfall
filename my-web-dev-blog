            <p class="main-p"> Today, I learnt the basics of HTML and how to create different kinds of sectioning. I have not yet learnt CSS, although I want to learn it soon. HTML seems fun so far even if a bit challenging because it is quite different from Python. Part of the basics we learnt today include how to create titles, headings, and paragraphs, as well as how to create tables. </p>

            <p class="main-p"> This week, I learnt how to pair HTML and CSS together to create aesthetic website organisation. CSS makes HTML look better by giving HTML as the website skeleton "skin". CSS is also not very difficult personally, and I enjoy doing it. </p>

            <p class="main-p"> This week we dove more into CSS formatting, most notably nested elements, positioning, flex-boxes, and z-index. In class, we played two games, the first revolving around learning nested elements, and the second one being a frog game teaching flex-boxes. I find flex-boxes will be especially useful in the future, despite being challenging to learn. I find flex-boxes will be especially useful in the future. </p>

            <p class="main-p"> we learned how to make images flexible and resize according to screen layouts. We dove in a little more into flex-layout, and finally put our github page together even though my computer turned off during class and I did not bring my charger. We are now able to use github from visual studio code though.</p>
